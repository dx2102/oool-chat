# OoolChat

This is a webpage to call LLM APIs. 

It provides a clean, fast, and simple baseline for LLM chat interfaces/GUI.

All the code is in a single html file. 

Simply paste the code into LLMs to check/customize it.

Goals:
- Concise, single-file code
- Easy to customize with LLMs or check for safety
- Design:
  - Consistent layout and color
  - Readable, high-contrast text

More goals (Done):
- Streaming output
- Stop Generation
- Multi-line input bar
- Store chat history locally
- Search bar
- Markdown rendering
- Code highlighting
- Copy button

Future goals:
- Fix CJK characters in markdown
- Edit message
- List and jump to messages
- Change API Keys
- Multiple APIs
- Presets (system prompts, `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`)
