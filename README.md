This is a simple web app to call LLM APIs. 

It aims to create a clean and fast UI baseline, while remaining a single HTML file.

Simply paste the code into LLMs to safety-check/customize it.

Main Goals:
- Concise, single-file code
- Easy to customize with LLMs or check for safety
- Design:
  - Consistent layout and color (tailwind)
  - Readable, high-contrast text
